# Trump Towers' Golden Showers
## AKA Help Donald Trump Find His Piss Tapes

Trump Towers' Golden Showers was the final project of Pamela Gregoretti ([@pgregoretti](https://github.com/pgregoretti)), Molly Sall ([@mollysall](https://github.com/mollysall)), and Zophie Quan ([@zyq6qe](https://github.com/zyq6qe)) for CS 4730 - Computer Game Design Spring 2017 at University of Virginia. The class required building your own 2D video game engine in Java, requiring basic physics, tweening, and other video game mechanics. All code was written by us, with most of the art completed by Zophie. Music and some sprites were found online but I do not remember where. Please don't get mad!

Every semester, all of the student projects of CS 4730 are featured in a free video game expo for all UVA students and faculty to see. Our project won Audience Favorite through a 3 ticket voting system, resulting in some sweet Amazon gift cards.

# How to Play

Trump will have to survive 3 levels: Trump Towers, a locker room, and the white house. Afterwards, he will have to fight Hillary Clinton, who is shooting fireballs at him. Your points from the previous three levels get converted into bullets, so try to score as many points as possible for the boss fight!
